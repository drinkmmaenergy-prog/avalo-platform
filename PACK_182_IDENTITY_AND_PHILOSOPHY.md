## MONETIZATION PRINCIPLES

### Core Rules

1. **Every paid interaction follows 100 tokens entry** (unless chat price moderation is explicitly enabled)

2. **Revenue split:**
   - **65% to the earning user**
   - **35% to Avalo**

3. **No free tokens, no discounts, no cashback, no "first chat is free"**

4. **Romance and chemistry are the engine; token economy is the monetization layer on top**

---

## SAFETY

### Age Verification & Identity

- **18+ only**, selfie + age verification required for all users

### Meeting Safety

- **Meeting logic** (QR code, selfie, Panic Button) is **mandatory** for offline encounters

### Anti-Fraud & Anti-Abuse

- **Anti-fraud and anti-abuse are enforced without killing romance**
- Safety measures protect users while preserving the authentic dating experience

---

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Product Design

All features, UX flows, and business logic must align with:

1. **Bold dating identity** — attraction and flirting are core to the experience
2. **Adult-first positioning** — we serve 18+ users who want romance and chemistry
3. **Monetization clarity** — creators earn from attention; consumers invest in connections
4. **Safety without censorship** — protect users but don't sanitize adult interactions

### Content Moderation

- Allow sexy, attractive content within platform store guidelines
- Block explicit pornography and illegal content
- Never shame users for being attractive or flirtatious
- Context matters: spicy chat between consenting adults is different from harassment

### Business Strategy

- Differentiation: honest about sexuality, monetization, and real-world chemistry
