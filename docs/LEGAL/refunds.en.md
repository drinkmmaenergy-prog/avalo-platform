# Refund & Cancellation Policy

**Version 1.0.0**  
**Effective Date: December 13, 2024**

## Overview

This policy defines refund rules for all Avalo services. All time references are in your local timezone.

## 1. Token Purchases

### General Rule
Token purchases are **non-refundable** except as required by mandatory law (e.g., EU consumer protection, payment provider policies).

### Exceptions
- Unauthorized transactions (fraud/hacking)
- Technical errors resulting in non-delivery
- Duplicate charges

To request a refund for exceptions: support@avalo.app with transaction ID.

## 2. Chat Services

### How It Works
- Tokens are spent in "word buckets" during conversations
- You pre-purchase access to conversation buckets
- Usage is consumed as messages are exchanged

### Refund Rules
✅ **Refundable**: Unused tokens/words when:
- Chat expires without full bucket consumption
- Chat is ended by either party early
- Conversation partner becomes unavailable

❌ **Non-Refundable**:
- Avalo commission (20%) on already-consumed word buckets
- Tokens spent on messages already sent/received

### Example
- You buy 1000-word bucket for 100 tokens
- You use 500 words, chat ends
- **Refund**: ~50 tokens (unused portion)
- **Kept**: Avalo's commission on consumed 500 words

## 3. Calendar Bookings (1-on-1 Meetings)

### Revenue Split
- **80%** to meeting provider (earner)
