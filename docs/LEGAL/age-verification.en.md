# Age Gate & Verification Policy

**Version 1.0.0**  
**Effective Date: December 13, 2024**

## Age Requirement

**Avalo is strictly 18+ only.** You must be at least 18 years old to create an account or use any part of the platform.

## Why We Verify Age

- **Legal Compliance**: Dating platforms with adult content require age verification
- **Safety**: Protect minors from accessing adult-oriented content
- **Community Standards**: Ensure all users are legal adults
- **Trust**: Build a safe, age-appropriate community

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Registration
- Provide date of birth during signup
- Must indicate you are 18 or older

### Step 2: Mandatory Selfie Verification
After registration, you **must** complete selfie verification to use the platform:

1. **Take a real-time selfie** within the app
2. **AI-powered age estimation** analyzes facial features
3. **Liveness detection** ensures photo is not fake/recycled
4. **Result**: Pass or fail within seconds

### What We Check
- Estimated age based on facial analysis
- Photo is live (not screenshot or uploaded image)
- Face is clearly visible
- Single person in frame

### Standards
- Must appear to be 18 or older
- Clear, well-lit photo required
- No filters, masks, or obstructions

## Verification Results

### ✅ Pass
- Immediate full platform access
- Profile becomes active
- Can start matching and messaging

### ❌ Fail
- Account restricted to verification screen only
- Cannot access any platform features
- Must retry verification or appeal

## Retry & Appeal Process

### Automatic Retries
- First fail: Can retry immediately
- Second fail: 24-hour waiting period
- Third fail: Account flagged for manual review

### Manual Appeal
If repeated failures occur:

1. **Contact Support**: support@avalo.app
2. **Subject**: "Age Verification Appeal - [User ID]"
3. **Provide**:
   - Explanation of issue (poor lighting, photo quality, etc.)
   - Government-issued ID (optional, for expedited review)
   - Confirmation you are 18+

4. **Review**: Manual review within 2-5 business days
5. **Decision**: Final determination by safety team

### Enhanced ID Verification (Optional)
For faster resolution:
- Upload government-issued photo ID
- We verify: Name, date of birth, photo match
- Processed securely and deleted after verification

## Data Privacy

### What We Store
- Verification status (pass/fail)
- Timestamp of verification
- Estimated age range (not exact)

### What We Don't Store
- Selfie images (deleted after verification)
- Government ID images (deleted after manual review)
- Biometric templates

### Security
- All verification data encrypted
- Processed using secure, GDPR-compliant systems
- No third-party access

## Enforcement

### Suspected Minors
If we suspect a user is under 18 (reports, behavior, etc.):
- Immediate account suspension
- Mandatory re-verification or ID check
- Permanent ban if confirmed minor

### Zero Tolerance
- Attempting to bypass age verification = permanent ban
- Using fake IDs = permanent ban + possible legal action
- Adult creating account for minor = permanent ban + reporting
