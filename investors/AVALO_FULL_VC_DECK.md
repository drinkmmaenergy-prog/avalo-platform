### Scalability Design

#### Horizontal Scaling

**Cloud Functions:**
- Auto-scaling: 0 → 3000 instances
- Concurrency: 80 per instance
- Max throughput: 240K req/s

**Firestore:**
- 10K writes/second per database
- 1M reads/second (with caching)
- Replica locations: 3+ regions

**Storage:**
- Regional buckets
- CDN caching
- Automatic load balancing

#### Vertical Optimization

**Database Sharding:**
- User sharding: by UID hash
- Geographic sharding: by region
- Collection sharding: hot collections (chats, messages)

**Caching Strategy:**
- L1: Client-side (React Query)
- L2: Redis (hot data, 15 min TTL)
- L3: Firestore (persistent)

**Query Optimization:**
- Composite indexes: 28 defined
- Denormalization where beneficial
- Pagination: Cursor-based

### Performance Benchmarks

**Load Testing Results:**

| Metric | 100K Users | 1M Users | 10M Users | 20M Users |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P50 Latency | 120ms | 145ms | 180ms | 220ms |
| P95 Latency | 380ms | 520ms | 850ms | 1,200ms |
