cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions:getMyCampaigns,functions:createCampaign,functions:updateCampaign,functions:addBudget,functions:fetchPromotionsForPlacement,functions:logPromotionImpression,functions:logPromotionClick
```

### 2. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3. Initialize Promotion Config
Create document: `promotion_config/global`
```json
{
  "tokensPerImpression": 1,
  "maxPromotionsPerFeedPage": 2,
  "maxPromotionsPerMarketplacePage": 2,
  "maxPromotionsPerHomeView": 1
}
```

### 4. Mobile App Update
- Rebuild app with new screens and services
- Test promotion display in Discovery/Marketplace/Home
- Verify impression/click logging

---

## 📱 Creator Workflow

1. **Access Promotions**
   - Navigate to Creator Tools → Promotions

2. **Create Campaign**
   - Enter campaign name, title, subtitle
   - Select placements (Discovery, Marketplace, Home)
   - Set NSFW flag if applicable
   - Define targeting (optional)
   - Set initial budget in tokens
   - Tokens immediately deducted from balance

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - View impressions and clicks
   - Track remaining budget (tokens)
   - Pause/resume campaigns as needed

4. **Add Budget**
   - Increase token allocation for active campaigns
   - Additional tokens deducted immediately

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Viewer Perspective
- Promotions appear as "Sponsored" cards in feeds
- Visually distinct with yellow/amber accent
- Only shown if marketing consent granted
- NSFW promotions hidden from non-verified users
- Tapping navigates to deep link (profile, marketplace, etc.)

### Creator Perspective
- Dedicated promotions management section
- Campaign creation with live preview
- Real-time stats (impressions, clicks, budget)
- Self-service budget management
- Clear pricing: tokens per impression

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Campaign Ownership**
   - Only campaign owner can modify their campaigns
   - Backend validates ownership on all operations

2. **Token Security**
   - Token deductions happen in transactions
   - Balance checked before campaign creation
   - No refunds (matches existing token policy)

3. **Eligibility Checks**
   - Age verification enforced
   - Enforcement status checked before serving
   - Marketing consent validated per request

4. **Event Logging**
   - Impressions logged once per view
   - Clicks tracked separately
   - Backend-only writes to prevent abuse

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Not in This Pack)

- Advanced targeting (interests, behavior)
- A/B testing for campaign variations
- External ad network integration
- CPC (cost-per-click) billing option
- Daily budget pacing algorithms
- Conversion tracking
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Automated campaign optimization
