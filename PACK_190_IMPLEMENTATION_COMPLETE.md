## Core Positioning

### The Slogan

**"Avalo = dating with real chemistry — where attention has value."**

## Strategic Differentiation

### vs Tinder/Badoo
- ✅ **Same**: Dating and romantic connection focus
- ✅ **Better**: Real chemistry matching + **monetization built-in**

### vs OnlyFans
- ✅ **Same**: Earning from beauty/attention + token economy
- ✅ **Better**: **Romantic context** instead of explicit content

### Unique Value Proposition

Avalo occupies the **intersection** of:
1. Real dating with romantic chemistry (like Tinder/Badoo)
2. Monetization of attention and beauty (like OnlyFans)
3. **Safe, romantic paid interactions** (unique to Avalo)

This positioning makes Avalo the **only platform** where:
- Beautiful people can earn from romantic attention
- Singles can find real chemistry AND support creators
