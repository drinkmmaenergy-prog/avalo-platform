**How Avalo Speaks**

---

## OVERWRITE NOTICE

**THIS PACK FULLY REPLACES PREVIOUS PACK 183.**  
**DO NOT MERGE WITH EARLIER LOGIC.**  
**REMOVE THE PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLY THIS ONE 1:1.**

---

## GOAL

Define how Avalo "speaks" in all UX, copy, microcopy, notifications and marketing — as a **sexy, confident, premium dating brand**, not a sterile or moralizing app.

---

## BRAND PERSONALITY

### Avalo's Voice Is:

✅ **Bold** — not afraid of desire and attraction

✅ **Sexy** — comfortable with adult sensuality

✅ **Playful** — flirty, teasing, light

✅ **Premium** — never vulgar, never cheap

✅ **Supportive** — especially towards women monetizing their presence

### Avalo Never Sounds:

❌ Judgmental

❌ Prudish / anti-sex

❌ Shaming women for being attractive

❌ Anti-dating or anti-romance

---

## VOICE RULES — ALWAYS

### Always:

**1. Normalize Attraction**

- "It's ok to be desired."
- "It's ok to enjoy flirting."
- "Attraction is natural — own it."

**2. Encourage Dating and Chemistry**

- "If the vibe is right, make a move."
- "Chemistry doesn't wait — neither should you."
- "Turn that spark into something real."

**3. Support Women Making Money from Attention**

- "Your time has value. Let people invest in it."
- "Being desired is profitable — when you're in control."
- "They want your attention. Make it worth your while."

**4. Speak to Men Honestly**

- "If you want her attention, show it and invest in it."
- "Quality women don't have time for low-effort guys."
- "Stand out or stay invisible."

---

## VOICE RULES — NEVER

### Never:

❌ Say or imply **"no dating"**, **"no flirting"**, **"no romance"**

❌ Shame users for:
   - Being sexy
   - Posting attractive photos within allowed boundaries
   - Enjoying erotic tension in chat (18+)

❌ Use language like:
   - "This is not a dating app."
   - "Do not flirt."
   - "Romantic behavior is discouraged."

**⚠️ Any such old phrasing must be considered obsolete and replaced immediately.**

---

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD COPY

### Profile & Discovery

✅ "You look incredible — let the right people notice you."

✅ "Someone you'd definitely flirt with just liked you."

✅ "Your vibe attracted someone who's willing to invest."

### Engagement & Chemistry

✅ "Feeling bold tonight? Start a conversation that might change your weekend."

✅ "The chemistry's there. Take the next step."

✅ "They've been checking your profile. Time to make your move."

### Safety & Respect

✅ "Flirting is natural. Do it with protection, respect and clear rules."

✅ "Bold moves, safe choices — that's the Avalo way."

✅ "Sexual tension is hot. Harassment isn't. Know the difference."

### Monetization

✅ "Your attention is valuable. Price it accordingly."

✅ "Make them invest before they waste your time."

✅ "100 tokens to start — because you're worth it."

---

## EXAMPLES OF BANNED COPY

- "Avalo is not about dating or flirting."
- "Romantic or sexual content is not acceptable."
- "Sexy photos are not welcome here."
- "This is a friendship platform only."
- "Keep conversations professional and appropriate."
- Any copy that frames attraction as a problem

- "This is a bold dating platform for adults."
- "Keep it spicy, keep it safe."
- Copy that frames attraction as natural and monetizable

---

## UX MICROCOPY AREAS

This tone **MUST** be applied to:

### Primary Touchpoints

1. **Onboarding screens**
   - First impressions set the bold, sexy tone
   - Example: "Welcome to where attraction pays off"

2. **Welcome screens**
   - Reinforce the permission to be sexy and flirtatious
   - Example: "You're hot. Let's make that profitable."

3. **Push notifications**
   - Encourage engagement with playful, flirty language
   - Example: "Someone who's your type just invested 100 tokens to chat"

4. **In-app banners**
   - Promote features with bold, confident copy
   - Example: "Weekend plans? Turn matches into dates."

### Feature-Specific Copy

5. **"Chemistry" events**
   - Highlight romantic/sexual tension opportunities
   - Example: "Chemistry alert: 3 people you'd definitely flirt with are online now"

6. **Weekend boosts**
   - Frame as dating/hookup opportunities
   - Example: "Friday night energy — boost your profile and see who's feeling you"

7. **Profile creation hints**
   - Encourage attractive, confident presentation
   - Example: "That photo? That's the one. Post it."

8. **Challenge descriptions**
   - Make challenges fun, flirty, and engaging
   - Example: "Get 10 guys to buy you virtual drinks this weekend"

### Monetization Copy

9. **Token purchase prompts**
   - Frame spending as investment in romantic connection
   - Example: "Invest in chemistry. Buy tokens to unlock real conversations."

10. **Pricing displays**
    - Be direct and confident about value exchange
    - Example: "Her rate: 100 tokens per chat. Worth it? You decide."

### Safety & Support

11. **Safety reminders**
    - Balance safety with sex-positive framing
    - Example: "Meeting up? Hot. Using the Panic Button? Hotter."

12. **Support messages**
    - Supportive without being prudish
    - Example: "Blocked someone creepy? Good call. Your boundaries, your rules."

## TONE VARIATIONS BY CONTEXT

### Audience-Specific Tone

#### For Women (Creators)

#### For Men (Consumers)

**Tone:** Direct, challenging, honest

**Examples:**
- "Quality attention costs tokens. Can you afford her?"
- "She's hot, she knows it, and she's not replying for free."
- "Want her time? Prove you're worth hers."

#### For Both

**Tone:** Bold, flirty, premium

**Examples:**
- "Chemistry costs nothing. Access to it? That's another story."
