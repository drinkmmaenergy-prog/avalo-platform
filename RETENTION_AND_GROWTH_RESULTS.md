R₀ = 0.9 (sub-viral growth)
```

**After (Avalo 2.1)**:
```
R₀ = 2.8 invites × 48% conversion × 0.97 referrals
R₀ = 1.3 (viral growth!) 🚀
```

- **Sustainable organic growth** achieved
- CAC reduced by 18%
- Organic user acquisition: 58% → 71%

100%       → 48%    → 67%         → 58%         → 34%
```

**Viral Cycle Time**: 14 days (before) → 9 days (after)
