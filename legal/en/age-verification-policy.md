# Avalo Age Verification Policy
#### Avalo Legal — Updated: 2025-01-22

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2025

## Introduction

Avalo is an adults-only platform designed exclusively for users aged 18 years or older. Age verification is not merely a regulatory requirement—it is a fundamental pillar of platform safety, user protection, and legal compliance. This Policy outlines our comprehensive approach to age verification, ongoing monitoring, and enforcement.

We employ multiple verification methods, continuous monitoring systems, and strict enforcement protocols to ensure that all users meet our minimum age requirements. Our goal is to create a safe, age-appropriate environment where adults can connect, socialize, and engage in monetization activities without the presence of minors.

## Platform Safety Principles

### 1. Zero Tolerance for Minors
Avalo maintains absolute prohibition of:
- Users under 18 years of age
- Accounts registered using false age information
- Attempts to circumvent age verification systems
- Content depicting or involving minors
- Any minor presence on the platform in any capacity

Violations result in immediate permanent ban and reporting to authorities.

### 2. Multi-Layer Verification
Our age verification employs:
- Government-issued document verification
- Biometric facial analysis and liveness detection
- Database cross-checks with official records
- Behavioral analysis and pattern recognition
- Continuous monitoring and re-verification protocols

### 3. Privacy-First Approach
While stringent, our verification:
- Minimizes data collection to what's necessary
- Encrypts all verification documents at rest and in transit
- Deletes raw documents after verification (retains only confirmation)
- Complies with GDPR, CCPA, and privacy regulations
- Never shares identity documents with other users

### 4. Proactive Monitoring
Beyond initial verification:
- AI systems continuously monitor for minor indicators
- Automated flags for suspicious age-related patterns
- Regular re-verification for flagged accounts
- Community reporting tools for suspected minors
- Rapid response team for urgent minor safety issues

### 5. Transparent Enforcement
When violations occur:
- Immediate account suspension pending investigation
- Thorough review by trained safety specialists
- Clear communication of findings and actions
- Cooperation with law enforcement when required
- Support for affected users and community

## Enforcement and Moderation Process

### 1. Initial Registration Verification

#### Step 1: Age Declaration
During account creation:
- User declares birth date
- System calculates age
- Users under 18 automatically rejected
- Users 18+ proceed to next verification stage

#### Step 2: Basic Verification (All Users)
Required for basic platform access:
- Email verification
- Phone number verification (SMS code)
- Selfie upload with liveness detection
- Initial AI age estimation from selfie
- Agreement to Terms and age requirements

**Processing Time:** 1-5 minutes (automated)

#### Step 3: Enhanced Verification (For Monetization)
Required before using paid features:
- Government-issued ID upload (passport, driver's license, national ID)
- Second selfie holding ID document
- Liveness detection (blink, turn head, smile)
- Document authenticity check (security features, formatting)
- Face matching between selfie and ID photo
- Name and date of birth extraction and validation

**Processing Time:** 2-15 minutes (mostly automated, manual review if flagged)

#### Verification Decision
- **Approved:** Full platform access granted
